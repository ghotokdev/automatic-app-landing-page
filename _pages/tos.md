# Terms of Use

The terms (“us”, “we”, the “Company” or “Ghotok”) refer to Ghotok.

## 1. Acceptance of Terms of Use Agreement
By creating a Ghotok account, whether through a mobile device, mobile application or computer (collectively, the “Service”) you agree to be bound by (i) these Terms of Use, (ii) our Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, Arbitration Procedures (if applicable to you) and Safety Tips, each of which is incorporated by reference into this Agreement, and (iii) any terms disclosed and agreed to by you if you purchase additional features, products or services we offer on the Service (collectively, this "Agreement"). If you do not accept and agree to be bound by all of the terms of this Agreement, please do not use the Service.

We may make changes to this Agreement and to the Service from time to time. We may do this for a variety of reasons including to reflect changes in or requirements of the law, new features, or changes in business practices. The most recent version of this Agreement will be posted on the Service under your profile and also on www.ghotok.app, and you should regularly check for the most recent version. The most recent version is the version that applies. If the changes include material changes that affect your rights or obligations, we will notify you in advance of the changes by reasonable means, which could include notification through the Service or via email. If you continue to use the Service after the changes become effective, then you agree to the revised Agreement.

## 2. Eligibility
You must be at least 18 years of age to create an account on Ghotok and use the Service. By creating an account and using the Service, you represent and warrant that:

* you can form a binding contract with Ghotok,
* you are not a person who is barred from using the Service under the laws of any applicable jurisdiction,
* you will comply with this Agreement and all applicable local, national and international laws, rules and regulations, and
* you have never been convicted of a felony or indictable offense (or crime of similar severity), a sex crime, or any crime involving violence, and that you are not required to register as a sex offender with any sex offender registry.


## 3. Your Account
In order to use Ghotok, you may create an account and sign in through the application. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials you use to sign up for Ghotok, and you are solely responsible for all activities that occur under those credentials. If you think someone has gained access to your account, please immediately contact us.

## 4. Modifying the Service and Termination
Ghotok is always striving to improve the Service and bring you additional functionality that you will find engaging and useful. This means we may add new product features or enhancements from time to time as well as remove some features, and if these actions do not materially affect your rights or obligations, we may not provide you with notice before taking them. We may even suspend the Service entirely, in which event we will notify you in advance unless extenuating circumstances, such as safety or security concerns, prevent us from doing so.

You may terminate your account at any time, for any reason, by following the instructions in "Settings" in the Service, however if you use a third party payment account, you will need to manage in-app purchases through that account (e.g., iTunes, Google Play) to avoid additional billing. Ghotok may terminate your account at any time without notice if it believes that you have violated this Agreement. Upon such termination, you will not be entitled to any refund for purchases. After your account is terminated, this Agreement will terminate, except that the following provisions will still apply to you and Ghotok: Section 4, Section 5, and Sections 11 through 14.

## 5. Safety; Your Interactions with Other Members
Though Ghotok strives to encourage a respectful member experience through features like the double opt-in that allows members to communicate only after they have both indicated interest in one another, it is not responsible for the conduct of any member on or off of the Service. You agree to use caution in all interactions with other members, particularly if you decide to communicate off the Service or meet in person. In addition, you agree to review and follow Ghotok’s Safety Tips prior to using the Service. You agree that you will not provide your financial information (for example, your credit card or bank account information), or wire or otherwise send money to other members.

YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER MEMBERS. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT GHOTOK DOES NOT CONDUCT CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS ON ITS MEMBERS OR OTHERWISE INQUIRE INTO THE BACKGROUND OF ITS MEMBERS. GHOTOK MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES AS TO THE CONDUCT OF MEMBERS.

Ghotok's license to your Content shall be non-exclusive, except that Ghotok's license shall be exclusive with respect to derivative works created through use of the Service. For example, Ghotok would have an exclusive license to screenshots of the Service that include your Content. In addition, so that Ghotok can prevent the use of your Content outside of the Service, you authorize Ghotok to act on your behalf with respect to infringing uses of your Content taken from the Service by other members or third parties.

Our license to your Content is subject to your rights under applicable law (for example laws regarding personal data protection to the extent any Content contains personal information as defined by those laws) and is for the limited purpose of operating, developing, providing, and improving the Service and researching and developing new ones. You agree that any Content you place or that you authorize us to place on the Service may be viewed by other members and may be viewed by any person visiting or participating in the Service (such as individuals who may receive shared Content from other Ghotok members).

You understand and agree that we may monitor or review any Content you post as part of a Service. We may delete any Content, in whole or in part, that in our sole judgment violates this Agreement or may harm the reputation of the Service.

When communicating with our customer care representatives, you agree to be respectful and kind. If we feel that your behavior towards any of our customer care representatives or other employees is at any time threatening or offensive, we reserve the right to immediately terminate your account.

In consideration for Ghotok allowing you to use the Service, you agree that we, our affiliates, and our third-party partners may place advertising on the Service.

Please be informed that Ghotok may access, store and disclose your account information and Content if required to do so by law, by performing its agreement with you, or in a good faith belief that such access, storage or disclosure satisfies a legitimate interest, including to: (i) comply with legal process; (ii) enforce the Agreement; (iii) respond to claims that any Content violates the rights of third parties; (iv) respond to your requests for customer service; or (v) protect the rights, property or personal safety of the Company or any other person.

If you see Content on the Service that violates this Agreement, please report it within the Service.

## 10. Notice and Procedure for Making Claims of Copyright Infringement
