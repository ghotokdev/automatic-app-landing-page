# Cookie Policy

## Introduction
Ghotok is committed to protecting your privacy. We aim to provide trustworthy, industry-leading products and services so that you can focus on building meaningful connections. Our approach to privacy is to provide you with clear information about our data practices. That’s why we've tried to keep legal and technical jargon to a minimum.

This Cookie Policy explains what cookies are, what types of cookies are placed on your device when you visit our website and app and how we use them.

This Cookie Policy does not address how we deal with your personal information generally. To learn more about how we process your personal information, please see our Privacy Policy.


## What are cookies?
Cookies are small text files that are sent to or accessed from your web browser or your device’s memory. A cookie typically contains the name of the domain (internet location) from which the cookie originated, the “lifetime” of the cookie (i.e., when it expires) and a randomly generated unique number or similar identifier. A cookie also may contain information about your device, such as user settings, browsing history and activities conducted while using our services.

## Are there different types of cookies?
First-party and third-party cookies
There are first-party cookies and third-party cookies. First-party cookies are placed on your device directly by us. Third-party cookies are placed on your device by our partners and service providers.

## Session and persistent cookies
There are session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies only last until you close your app. We use session cookies for a variety of reasons, including to learn more about your use of our app during one single browser session and to help you to use our app more efficiently. Persistent cookies have a longer lifespan and aren't automatically deleted when you close your browser. These types of cookies are primarily used to help you quickly sign-in to our app again and for analytical purposes.

## What about other tracking technologies?
Other technologies such as web beacons (also calls pixel tags or clear gifs), tracking URLs or software development kits (SDKs) are used for similar purposes. Web beacons are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our service or opened an email that we have sent them. Tracking URLs are custom generated links that help us understand where the traffic to our webpages and app comes from. SDKs are small pieces of code included in apps, which function like cookies and web beacons.

For simplicity, we also refer to these technologies as “cookies” in this Cookie Policy.

## What do we use cookies for?
Like most providers of online services, we use cookies to provide, secure and improve our services, including by remembering your preferences, recognizing you when you visit our app and personalizing and tailoring the experience to your interests. To accomplish these purposes, we also may link information from cookies with other personal information we hold about you.

When you visit our app, some or all of the following types of cookies may be set on your device.

### Essential app cookies	
These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our app and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas.

### Analytics cookies	
These cookies help us understand how our app is being used, how effective marketing campaigns are, and help us customize and improve our app for you.

## How can you control cookies?

There are several cookie management options available to you. Please note that changes you make to your cookie preferences may make browsing our app a less satisfying experience. In some cases, you may even find yourself unable to use all or part of our site.

You may be able to reset device identifiers by activating the appropriate setting on your mobile device. The procedure for managing device identifiers is slightly different for each device. You can check the specific steps in the help or settings menu of your particular device.

## Google Analytics
We use Google Analytics, which is a Google service that uses cookies and other data collection technologies to collect information about your use of the app and services in order to report app trends.
